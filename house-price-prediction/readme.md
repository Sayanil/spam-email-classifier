# House Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning to predict house prices based on features such as
area and number of bedrooms. A Linear Regression model is trained on sample data
to demonstrate the complete ML workflow.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
